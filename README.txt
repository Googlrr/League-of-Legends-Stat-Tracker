League of Legends Stat Tracker Version 1.0	01/20/2014

DESCRIPTION
------------

League of Legends Stat tracker is my solution to the lack of adequeate stat
tracking within the League of Legends client. This program is designed to
save the stats of all games across all game types. The project started out 
as an exploration in working with databases and working with the Riot Games
API (riot.developer.com).

NOTES
-------------
The initial startup of the program may take a few seconds. Starting the 
database doesn't always seem to be a quick process.

TO-DO
-------------
-Look at the database code and see if it can be optimized to read and write faster.

-Allow user to sort games by game mode to separate 3v3 and 5v5 gamesmodes as well as
ranked and unranked.
